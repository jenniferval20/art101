					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab we practiced experimenting with arrays and objects! 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had trouble with our Javascript as the program would not run in HTML on our browsers. However, the problem we had was not fixing the errors but finding them. Our VS Code would not show where the errors were so we were stuck on how to move forward. Eventually we were able to troubleshoot and find the cause of our errors and fix them! 
						Even though we fixed our JS, This was not the last of our problems. We then had trouble correctly linking our JS with HTML which also took extra time to correct. After we fixed this issue our code worked perfectly!

					<p> After troubleshooting everything went great!</p>
